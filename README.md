Funny Project made with react.js and MongoDB.

The project is not deployed yet, but I shortly repair on that.

The application allows users to add simple post to a webpage. Before being posted the message of the user is filtered according 
with its tone by the TONE ANALIZER API ---> https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net/. All the users' post are stored in a MongoDB
database thanks the help of a server file that you can find in the "back-end" folder made with node.js.
All the posts are then displayed in different colors according to the emotion assigned by the API.
